	abstract = {A suite of observationally driven model experiments is used to investigate the contribution of near-surface lateral eddy mixing to the subtropical surface salinity maxima in the global ocean. Surface fields of salinity are treated as a passive tracer and stirred by surface velocities derived from altimetry, leading to irreversible water-mass transformation. In the absence of surface forcing and vertical processes, the transformation rate can be directly related to the integrated diffusion across tracer contours, which is determined by the observed velocities. The destruction rates of the salinity maxima by lateral mixing can be compared to the production rates by surface forcing, which act to strengthen the maxima. The ratio of destruction by eddy mixing in the surface layer versus the surface forcing exhibits regional differences in the mean—from 10\% in the South Pacific to up to 25\% in the south Indian. Furthermore, the regional basins show seasonal and interannual variability in eddy mixing. The dominant mechanism for this temporal variability varies regionally. Most notably, the North Pacific shows a large sensitivity to the background salinity fields and a weak sensitivity to the velocity fields, while the North Atlantic exhibits the opposite behavior. The different mechanism for temporal variability could have impacts on the manifestation of a changing hydrological cycle in the sea surface salinity (SSS) field specifically in the North Pacific. The authors find evidence for large-scale interannual changes of eddy diffusivity and transformation rate in several ocean basins that could be related to large-scale climate forcing.},

	abstract = {The subtropical North Atlantic exhibits the saltiest surface waters of the open ocean. Eventually that water subducted from the surface and exported toward the Equator, as a subsurface salinity maximum (S-max) forming the lower limb of the subtropical cell. Climatologically, the winter subtropical surface water, coinciding with the deepest mixed layer of \$100 m, is saltier and colder than the S-max. Towed CTD measurements in March/April 2013 (a component of the ﬁeld program SPURS) within the North Atlantic subtropical surface salinity maximum reveal several relatively fresh, warm anomalies, which deviate strongly from climatological conditions. These features introduce a large amount of freshwater into the subtropical region, exceeding the amount introduced by local rain events. Observed scales and evolution of the features strongly suggest a connection to mesoscale dynamics. This is supported by high-resolution regional model output, which produces an abundance of features that are similar in scale and structure to those observed. It is hypothesized that turbulent transport in the surface ocean is a crucial process for setting mixed layer characteristics, which spread into S-max stratum. High variability in the EKE implies a high potential for interannual variability in the resulting S-max water properties by ocean dynamics in addition to the variability caused by air sea ﬂuxes. This has likely consequences to the meridional transport of heat and freshwater of the subtropical cell in the North Atlantic and to the larger-scale ocean and climate system.},

	abstract = {Bottom water export from the Ross Sea, February 2007 to January 2011, exhibits seasonal and interannual variability. Temperature minima coupled to salinity maxima in late austral summer, into the fall, indicate input from High-Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW). Secondary temperature minima lacking the high-salinity trait, characteristic of Low-Salinity Shelf Water (LSSW), appear in the spring. Warmer bottom water similar to modiﬁed Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) is observed in winter and in early summer. The LSSW and mCDW may be drawn from the Drygalski Basin, as the HSSW pool retreats poleward from the shelf break in response to increased winter polar easterlies allowing these less dense overlying waters to spill into the deep ocean within the benthic layer. Bottom salinity decreased from 2007 to 2011 by 0.007 yearÀ1 signiﬁcantly higher than regional decadal trends, which we propose is a result of HSSW retreat induced by strengthening polar easterlies.},

The SSS-max ﬂuctuated in surface area—as deﬁned by the 37.4 surface isohaline—during the course of the Aquarius time series by about 67\%. The SSS-max has a surprisingly large amount of non-seasonal variability, including a general decrease in salinity throughout the eastern subtropical North Atlantic between 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 of about 0.1–0.2. The documented seasonal variability is weakest in the maximum salinity area and increases toward the north and south, respectively. This is consistent with the important role played by Ekman transport and regional excess of evaporation over precipitation in the formation of the SSS-max.},

Ocean circulation and mixing processes inject freshwater, establishing a quasi-steady state, though imbalances across the time spectrum result in periods of increasing and decreasing SSS-max. The integrated effect of the array of atmospheric and oceanic forces governing sea surface salinity is shaped by the specific regional ocean basin configuration as well as their coupling to the global ocean system, resulting in SSS-max patterns and locations that display marked differences between the subtropical regimes. We provide a brief description of the SSS-max characteristics of the five subtropical regimes and present aspects of their regional settings that may account for their dissimilarities.},
