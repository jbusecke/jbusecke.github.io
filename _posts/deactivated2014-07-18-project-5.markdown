description: "Vast stretches of the tropical oceans have very low oxygen concentration in the subsurface.
Organic particles,  like dead plankton and feces, 'rain' from the surface ocean and are decomposed within the water column. During this process oxygen is consumed. The consumption of oxygen is balanced by the supply of oxygenated waters by the ocean circulation. Along the eastern boundaries of most ocean basins, the circulation is sluggish and does not provide as much oxygen as elsewhere, resulting in areas with very low oxygen called the oxygen minimum zones (OMZ's).

OMZs and more specific their volume and spatial extent are important for global biogeochemical cycles as well as large local fisheries, since certain species of fish and other seafood either avoid areas of low oxygen or are killed by decreasing oxygen.

Modern earth system models do not provide a clear answer to the question, whether OMZs are going to expand or shrink with a warming climate.
We need to understand in more detail the processes that maintain the OMZ and how they are represented in earth system models to improve future projections.

I focus on the role of the equatorial current system (in particular the equatorial Undercurrent) and mesoscale eddies on providing oxygen to the OMZs."
